  <h1>USC tech team introduces new learning tools and creates an online community</h1>
  <p>Online collaboration tools like Zoom can bring students, faculty members and university employees together in a virtual world. But USC tech leaders knew these tools had to connect with each other to work well. They also needed to pull in data from across USC, such as a user’s identity and relationship to the university.</p>

  <p>“We can’t just introduce technologies if they don’t know who you are and what courses you’re in,” Garcia said. Behind every new technology are countless details the ITS staff had to sort through.</p>

  <p>Students can find these new tools on the Experience USC website. The platform brings together about 2 million pieces of information related to the university’s 47,000-plus enrollees. When they log into Experience USC, students see event listings, ways to get involved with other students through clubs and organizations, and useful information on academics, wellness, career advancement and more.</p>

  <p>“It’s all meant to create connection and community, to be one stop for students to post and share and interact, to find events that might be happening,” Garcia said. “All of that is powered by data.”</p>

  <p>Educators and USC employees also can find resources online. They’re available on the university’s dedicated We are SC website — all in an effort to put these new tools at the campus community’s fingertips.</p>

  <h1> High-tech classrooms give instructors a sense of comfort in uncertain times </h1>
  <p>Fortunately, USC got a head start on shifting to a temporary online learning model. The university already had launched a broad effort to upgrade hundreds of classrooms for wireless sharing and hybrid teaching well before the pandemic.</p>

  <p>“When COVID hit, people started asking me what we were going to do, and I could tell them: ‘We actually have a solution,’” said Joe Way, director of learning environments. “We’ve been planning for this. COVID just sped up our timeline.”</p>

  <p>Since March, ITS workers have run wires, hung ceiling microphones, installed auto-tracking cameras and set up monitors in 226 classroom spaces across campus. The $2 million project features the latest high-tech equipment — and it’s all automated and touchless.</p>

  <p>Because the upgraded classrooms are connected to the university’s course schedule, the system knows what class is being taught at any given time. Faculty members simply have to set down their laptop, log on and start streaming. Although instructors don’t necessarily have to go to campus, Way said many instructors appreciate the opportunity to teach in a familiar setting.</p>

  <p>“Faculty members miss their classroom, and that makes sense,” he said. “They spend their entire career improving their craft in a certain environment, and this pandemic blew that all up for them. They are going to teach better when they are comfortable.”</p>

  <p>The massive tech overhaul has drawn attention from other audiovisual experts around the country. A leading industry association recently gave the project a top award.</p>

  <p>“These technologies have all existed, but nobody has ever put them all together on this level,” Way said. “A lot of people are watching us, and it’s pretty fun to have a mic-drop moment like this. The fact that we’re helping in a true emergency just makes it that much better.”</p>
