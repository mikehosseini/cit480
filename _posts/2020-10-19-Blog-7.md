<h2> PayPal has entered the cryptocurrency market, announcing 
     that its customers will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin 
     and other virtual currencies using their PayPal accounts.</h2>
<p>Those virtual coins could then be used to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said.</p>

<p>PayPal plans to roll out buying options in the US over the next few weeks, with the full rollout due early next year. </p>

<p>Bitcoin prices rose alongside the news, breaking the $12,000 (Â£9,170) mark.</p>

<p>The other cryptocurrencies to be added first will be Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash (a spin-off from Bitcoin).</p>

<p>All could be stored "directly within the PayPal digital wallet", the company said.</p>

<h1> Penny Stocks </h1>

<p> Cryptocurrencies have remained a niche payment method, partly down to the rapid change in prices they can experience compared with traditional state-backed currencies. That has made them popular among some types of investors. </p>

<p> PayPal said it was aiming "to increase consumer understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency". </p>

</p> "As part of this offering, PayPal will provide account holders with educational content to help them understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem," it said. </p>

<p> But David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain and the forthcoming Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money, said PayPal was describing "a crypto day-trading market". </p>

<p> "I'm at a loss as to who the market is for PayPal as a crypto-exchange," he said. </p>

<p> He likened it to playing the stock market, but with Bitcoin - whose volatile and less well-regulated nature was like "gambling on penny stocks". <p>

<p> "Have a flutter, drop $10 on it, you'll learn things you wouldn't learn any other way - but you are gambling," he warned. </p>

<p> He said there were "a lot of big players who manipulate the price", and ordinary people risked losing their money. </p>

<p> "I don't expect much of a market for this beyond existing crypto holders... I'm baffled that PayPal would offer this, and it's not clear what they're trying to do here," he said. </p>

<p> "There must be someone at PayPal who is very interested in cryptocurrencies," he added. </p>

<h1> Paying with crypto </h1>

<p> Other payment firms, such as Square's Cash app and Revolut, have already offered cryptocurrencies for sale. 
    But PayPal has one of the largest merchant networks in the world. </p>

<p> When it comes to using the virtual coins, PayPal will convert the cryptocurrency into the relevant national currency, so the company being paid will never receive the virtual coins - just the correct amount of pounds or dollars. </p>

<p> PayPal said the system meant there would be "certainty of value and no incremental fees". </p>

<p> But using Bitcoin to pay at ordinary merchants is not due to launch until "early 2021". </p>

<p> Cryptocurrencies' volatile prices - along with their historical use as a less traceable payment method for illegal purposes - have led to numerous calls for them to be regulated. </p>

<p> PayPal has been granted permission for its operation from the New York State Department of Financial Services, in the form of a conditional "Bitlicence" - the first such licence granted. To begin with, the service will work with an existing cryptocurrency provider in the US, the Paxos Trust Company. </p>
