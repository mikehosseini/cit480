# BitLocker
<p> While EFS protects files and folders, BitLocker is a volume-encryption technology that encrypts
the whole volume to protect data from unauthorized access. BitLocker was introduced for the
first time on the Windows Vista operating system; it has the following features:</p>

* BitLocker can encrypt an entire volume or only the used parts of a volume.
* BitLocker can use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to protect the integrity of the Windows startup process. BitLocker verifies that the required boot files have not been
  tampered with nor modified. If the verification process finds files that were modified—for example, by a rootkit or boot sector virus—then Windows does not start.
* BitLocker can require multifactor authentication, such as a PIN or a USB startup key.
* You can configure Network Unlock at Startup for BitLocker. With Network Unlock, the BitLocker-protected device will start automatically when it is connected to a trusted company network; otherwise, you will need to provide a startup PIN.
* BitLocker provides a recovery mechanism, a 48-digit recovery key, or a recovery agent to access the volume data if a TPM fails or the password is lost.
* BitLocker protects the whole volume from offline attacks. After the Windows device starts and users gain access to the protected volume, authorized users can access data on  the BitLocker-encrypted volume if they have the appropriate file permissions.
* You can combine BitLocker with EFS. BitLocker encrypts at the volume level, whereas EFS encrypts data at the file level.
* The BitLocker performance overhead is minimal. For most installations, the performance impact is not noticeable. The BitLocker drive encryption architecture is described in Figure below: ![blog10-1](https://github.com/mikehosseini/mikehosseini.github.io/blob/gh-pages/images/blog10-1.jpg?raw=true)

<p> Sectors are encrypted by the full-volume encryption key (FVEK). The FVEK is further
encrypted with the volume master key (VMK). The FVEK must be stored securely, because it
has the capability to decrypt the volume. The FVEK (encrypted with the VMK) is stored on the
disk as part of the volume metadata. The VMK is also encrypted (or protected) by one or more
key protectors. The default key protector is the TPM, but you can configure additional protectors,
such as a PIN and a USB startup key. If the device does not have a TPM, you can configure
BitLocker to store a key protector on a USB drive. For more information on BitLocker, visit the following link:</p>

#### Windows Firewall 
<p> You should always run Windows Firewall and open only the ports that
are needed for network communication of the specific server. Best practice is to work closely
with your colleagues from the other departments (such as network admins and AD admins)
so they can tell you what ports are being used by your infrastructure servers (such as domain
controllers and DNS servers) and application and database servers (such as intranet applications,
Exchange Server, SQL Server, Skype for Business, and SharePoint). </p>
#### Windows Updates 
<p> Most of the viral Internet attacks in the past spread over the Internet so
quickly because computers had not been updated with the latest operating system updates.
Furthermore, the updates that would have prevented those attacks weren’t newly released
updates; they were released long before an actual attack was executed. Remember, because
you are working with servers running different kinds of software, best practice is to test new
Windows updates in a nonproduction environment first, before you deploy them to production
servers.</p>
#### Anti-Malware Software 
<p> Depending on the type of a server, anti-malware protection must
be enabled and updated with latest malware definitions. Best practice is to be aware of application
restrictions on anti-malware software, such as for Exchange Server, where you need to
configure exclusions so that certain folders or file types are not scanned. Furthermore, ensure
that all other clients and devices in your network have anti-malware installed and updated. </p>
#### User Permissions 
<p> Users (including administrators) must have sufficient permissions to
perform their job-related activities and nothing more; this is also known as the “principle of
least privilege.” </p>
#### Admin Permissions 
<p> Even admins should work as standard users and only run administrative
tasks with elevated permissions, because any type of malware that tries to use user permissions
will be restricted to user-level permissions. </p>
#### User Credentials 
<p> Security best practices for user credentials are explained in other chapters
in this book, where you will read that passwords need to meet complexity requirements
in order to be more secure. Furthermore, password lockout policies must be in place to protect
against brute force attacks, where an attacker tries multiple combinations of words in order
to guess user passwords. </p>
<p> Be regularly informed about the latest security threats and read the recommendations and
best practices from the software and hardware vendors of the equipment and solutions you are
using in your organization. </p>
<p> Now that you have a foundation on which to learn, let’s get into the detailed planning for
security in Windows Server. </p>
