# BitLocker
<p> While EFS protects files and folders, BitLocker is a volume-encryption technology that encrypts
the whole volume to protect data from unauthorized access. BitLocker was introduced for the
first time on the Windows Vista operating system; it has the following features:</p>

* BitLocker can encrypt an entire volume or only the used parts of a volume.
* BitLocker can use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to protect the integrity of the Windows startup process. BitLocker verifies that the required boot files have not been
  tampered with nor modified. If the verification process finds files that were modified—for example, by a rootkit or boot sector virus—then Windows does not start.
* BitLocker can require multifactor authentication, such as a PIN or a USB startup key.
* You can configure Network Unlock at Startup for BitLocker. With Network Unlock, the BitLocker-protected device will start automatically when it is connected to a trusted company network; otherwise, you will need to provide a startup PIN.
* BitLocker provides a recovery mechanism, a 48-digit recovery key, or a recovery agent to access the volume data if a TPM fails or the password is lost.
* BitLocker protects the whole volume from offline attacks. After the Windows device starts and users gain access to the protected volume, authorized users can access data on  the BitLocker-encrypted volume if they have the appropriate file permissions.
* You can combine BitLocker with EFS. BitLocker encrypts at the volume level, whereas EFS encrypts data at the file level.
* The BitLocker performance overhead is minimal. For most installations, the performance impact is not noticeable. The BitLocker drive encryption architecture is described in Figure below:

<p> Sectors are encrypted by the full-volume encryption key (FVEK). The FVEK is further
encrypted with the volume master key (VMK). The FVEK must be stored securely, because it
has the capability to decrypt the volume. The FVEK (encrypted with the VMK) is stored on the
disk as part of the volume metadata. The VMK is also encrypted (or protected) by one or more
key protectors. The default key protector is the TPM, but you can configure additional protectors,
such as a PIN and a USB startup key. If the device does not have a TPM, you can configure
BitLocker to store a key protector on a USB drive. For more information on BitLocker, visit the following link: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview">BitLocker</a> </p>

<p> BitLocker uses the AES algorithm with 128-bit keys encryption by default. You can modify
this setting with Group Policy—for example, to configure the use of 256-bit keys. BitLocker
encrypts each volume sector individually, and part of the encryption key is derived from the
sector number. Therefore, each two sectors have different encrypted data, even if the two sectors
have the same unencrypted data. </p>
