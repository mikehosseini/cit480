# DHCP Scopes
<p> To configure the DHCP server to begin handing out addresses to clients, you need to create
a scope. The scope defines the IP address range as well as options such as subnet mask and
default gateway. </p>
<p> To create an IPv4 scope, follow these steps: </p>

1. In the DHCP management console, if necessary, expand the server and click IPv4.
2. Right-click IPv4 and click New Scope.
3. In the New Scope Wizard, click Next.
4. On the Scope Name page, in the Name box, enter a name for the scope and click Next. This name should be meaningful, so that you can easily understand where it is used.
5. On the IP Address Range page, shown in Figure, enter the correct Start IP address, End IP address, and Subnet mask, and then click Next.

6. On the Add Exclusions and Delay page, enter any IP address in the range that should not be given to clients. For example, you might have an IP address range that is reserved for printers.
7. In the Subnet Delay In Millisecond box, you can enter the number of milliseconds that this scope should wait before responding and then click Next. The delay is used in some
high-availability scenarios, but is not typically used.
8. On the Lease Duration page, enter how long you want clients to be able to use an IP address and click Next.
9. On the Configure DHCP Options page, click No, I Will Configure These Options Later and click Next.
10. On the Completing the New Scope Wizard page, click Finish.
11. In the DHCP management console, right-click the scope and click Activate. Just as DHCP servers need to be activated, so do scopes.
