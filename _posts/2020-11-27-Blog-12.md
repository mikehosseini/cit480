# DHCP Scopes
<p> To configure the DHCP server to begin handing out addresses to clients, you need to create
a scope. The scope defines the IP address range as well as options such as subnet mask and
default gateway. </p>
<p> To create an IPv4 scope, follow these steps: </p>

1. In the DHCP management console, if necessary, expand the server and click IPv4.
2. Right-click IPv4 and click New Scope.
3. In the New Scope Wizard, click Next.
4. On the Scope Name page, in the Name box, enter a name for the scope and click Next. This name should be meaningful, so that you can easily understand where it is used.
5. On the IP Address Range page, shown in Figure, enter the correct Start IP address, End IP address, and Subnet mask, and then click Next.

6. On the Add Exclusions and Delay page, enter any IP address in the range that should not be given to clients. For example, you might have an IP address range that is reserved for printers.
7. In the Subnet Delay In Millisecond box, you can enter the number of milliseconds that this scope should wait before responding and then click Next. The delay is used in some
high-availability scenarios, but is not typically used.
8. On the Lease Duration page, enter how long you want clients to be able to use an IP address and click Next.
9. On the Configure DHCP Options page, click No, I Will Configure These Options Later and click Next.
10. On the Completing the New Scope Wizard page, click Finish.
11. In the DHCP management console, right-click the scope and click Activate. Just as DHCP servers need to be activated, so do scopes.

<p> When you create a scope, the default lease length is eight days. Clients will attempt to renewbthat lease with the original DHCP server at 50 percent of lease length
(four days) and if not successful, again at 87.5 percent complete (seven days). If the lease cannot be renewed by the time the lease expires, then the client loses its IP address configuration and might obtain a lease from another DHCP server or begin using an APIPA address. </p>

 <p> While eight days ensures that clients can use the IP address for an extended period, it can also make it difficult to make network changes. For example, if you wanted to change the subnet mask for a scope, the earliest it could possibly take effect would be four days, because clients won’t get updated information until they renew. To facilitate making network changes, you should use a shorter lease time. Many organizations use a lease time of one day. On networks with a very high level of change, such as guest wireless networks, you might keep the lease time as short as an hour. </p>

<p> After a scope is created, you have the option to create reservations. A reservation is an IP address in the scope that is given to a specific DHCP client. The DHCP server identifies the client based on the client’s MAC address. So, you need to identify the MAC address of the client before you make a reservation. Alternatively, you can select an existing lease and convert it to a reservation. The IP address for a reservation must be within the IP address pool configured in the scope. </p>
