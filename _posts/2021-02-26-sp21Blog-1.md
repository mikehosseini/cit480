<h1> Terraform Block </h1>
<p> The <code>terraform {}</code> block is required so Terraform knows which provider to download from the Terraform Registry. In the configuration above, the aws provider's source is defined as <code>hashicorp/aws</code> which is shorthand for <code>registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws</pre>.</p>
<p> You can also assign a version to each provider defined in the <code>required_providers</code> block. The "version" argument is optional, but recommended. It is used to constrain the provider to a specific version or a range of versions in order to prevent downloading a new provider that may possibly contain breaking changes. If the version isn't specified, Terraform will automatically download the most recent provider during initialization.</p>

<h1> Providers </h1>
<p> The provider block configures the named provider, in our case aws, which is responsible for creating and managing resources. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to translate the API interactions with the service. A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Because Terraform can interact with any API, you can represent almost any infrastructure type as a resource in Terraform.</p>
<p> The profile attribute in your provider block refers Terraform to the AWS credentials stored in your AWS Config File, which you created when you configured the AWS CLI. HashiCorp recommends that you never hard-code credentials into <code>*.tf</code> configuration files. We are explicitly defining the default AWS config profile here to illustrate how Terraform should access sensitive credentials.</p>
<p> Multiple provider blocks can exist if a Terraform configuration manages resources from different providers. You can even use multiple providers together. For example you could pass the ID of an AWS instance to a monitoring resource from DataDog. </p>
