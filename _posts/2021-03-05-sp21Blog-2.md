<h1> Format and validate the configuration </h1>
<p> We recommend using consistent formatting in files and modules written by different teams. The terraform fmt command automatically updates configurations in the current directory for easy readability and consistency. Format your configuration. Terraform will return the names of the files it formatted. In this case, your configuration file was already formatted correctly, so Terraform won't return any file names. </p>
<pre><code> $ terraform fmt </code></pre>

<p> If you are copying configuration snippets or just want to make sure your configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, the built in terraform validate command will check and report errors within modules, attribute names, and value types. </p>

<p> Validate your configuration. If your configuration is valid, Terraform will return a success message. </p>

<pre><code> $ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid. </pre></code>

<h2> Create infrastructure </h2>
<p> In the same directory as the main.tf file you created, run terraform apply. Terraform will print output similar to what is shown below, though we've truncated some of the output to save space. </p>

<pre><code> $ terraform apply
