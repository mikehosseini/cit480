<p> Ansible is a free and opensource automation and content management tool that helps you <u> to control and manage remote servers from a central server or machine</u>. It is preferred over other automation technologies since it is easy to learn, install and configure. Ansible uses SSH protocol to communicate and manage remote hosts and does not require installation and setup of agents on the remote systems, unlike other automation systems. </p>

<h2> Setup Ansible in Linux Server</h2>
<p> Before you begin, open your terminal (or SSH for server installation), ensure you have Python version 2.7 or 3.5+ , and note your Linux server version by running:
  
<pre><code> cat /etc/release . </code></pre> </p>

<p> We can use Python Installs Packages (PIP) to install Ansible. Python Package Index is updated more regularly than many Linux package management systems. This also guarantees compatibility with InMotion Hosting Ansible Galaxy roles which require PIP packages.</p>

<p> If you need to install PIP first download "get-pip.py" by using <b>curl</b>: </p>

<pre><code> curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py </code></pre>

<p> Then run the following command in the folder where you have downloaded <code> get-pip.py </code>: </p>

<pre><code> python get-pip.py </code></pre>

<p> To upgrade your PIP:
  On Linux:
<pre><code> pip install -U pip </code></pre>
  On Windows:
<pre><code> python -m pip install -U pip </code></pre>  

<p> Then you can run: </p>

<pre><code> pip install --user ansible </code></pre>

<h2> Package Manager </h2>
<p> To use the native package manager, follow <b>official Ansible documentation</b> for your operating system (OS) â€“ CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, etc. </p>
