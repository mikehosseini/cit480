<h2> Wireshark Captures </h2>

<p> Wireshark is a network packet analyzer (also known as a packet sniffer). Wireshark is a computer
program that can intercept, log and display the traffic passing over a digital network (or part of a
network). It can be used to log data traveling over a variety of network types (cable, wireless) and,
provided that the content of the data packets is unencrypted, display that data in real time. </p>

<p> Packet sniffers like Wireshark can be used for a variety of purposes both good: </p>
1.  Analyze network problems and ï€  test network communication.
2.  Debug client/server communications and other network protocol communications.
3.  Monitor network usage and bandwidth (including internal and external users and systems).
4.  Detect network misuse by internal and external users.
5.  Detect network intrusion attempts (like port scanning).
6.  Filter suspect content from network traffic.

<h2>  Select a Network Device </h2>
<p> When you first start Wireshark you will be brought to the default startup screen. In order to begin a
network capture you will need to choose a network device to use. There are several ways to do this: for
now you can simply select the "List the Available Capture Devices" button.</p>

<p> In the pop-up box that appears you will need to select one of the devices available on your machine. </p>
<p> Most machines will only have one network interface available. </p>
<p> In the "Capture Options" window that appears uncheck the "Capture packets in promiscuous mode"
checkbox (we only want to capture messages sent directly to your own machine). The click "Start" in
both the "Capture Options" window and then in the "Capture Interfaces" window. </p>
